## Talk 1: Zend Framework 2 Lacks Documentation

Whilst Zend Framework 2â€™s a very capable framework, and a vast improvement on version 1, there's still so much that's unknown, undocumented, and not documented enough.

This talk gives developers, new to the framework, both an understanding of the essential elements, and an approach to using it which lays the foundation to become proficient and adept with it.

## Talk 2: Using Zend Framework 2 as a Freelancer

Zend Framework 2 has the reputation as being the enterprise framework of choice. But is it right for the freelancer or small team? Is there too much overhead for a team of only a few people? Can a small team use it to rapidly build client applications?

This talk shows that whilst full-featured, Zend Framework 2 is as much suited to smaller development teams, even freelancers, as it is for large, more corporate, development teams, by looking at 5 key areas of the framework.

## Talk 3: Prototyping and Production Development in Zend Framework 2 - 5 Key Examples

Are you aware of how to rapidly prototype applications using Zend Framework 2? Are you aware that you can, but that there's also a clear path to refactor the pro type code, to code which's production ready and maintainable? 

This talk looks at 5 areas of Zend Framework 2 working through this scenario, showing developers how to both rapidly prototype an application, then how to migrate the prototype code to a production ready application. 

## Talk 4: Diagnostics in Zend Framework 2 - Make Sure Your Module Will Work

Do you want confidence that users can verify your Zend Framework 2 modules will work in their environment, whether that's development, testing or production? 

Do you want a simple way users can check things like the PHP version and extensions, running services, directory permissions, security advisories and CPU performance? Do you want a way that makes your modules self-documenting? 

This talk shows developers how to use the Diagnostics component of ZFTool to do all this, featuring both the inbuilt classes as well as custom classes, which extend the existing functionality.
