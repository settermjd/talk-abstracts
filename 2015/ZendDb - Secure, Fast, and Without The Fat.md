Powerful, Flexible, Maintainable SQL Generation - Without The Hassle

Even though PHP was wedded to MySQL for years, and databases are nearly ubiquitous, creating SQL queries can still be a challenging task for a lot of us. What's the right option to take? Doctrine, whilst powerful, often feels like overkill. And using PDO directly can also be a challenge. So where do you turn to create flexible, secure, maintainable, and reusable queries? Have you considered Zend\Db?

In this session, I'll show you how to use Zend\Db to build a range of queries, from the simple, such as a basic select, through to the more complex, such as a reasonably sophisticated union query, with a minimum of fuss and effort. I'll show you how to build queries which have performance, security, maintainability, and flexibility baked right in.
